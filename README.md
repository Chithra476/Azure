# Azure - Terraform
# Azure services
This repository contains Terraform sample code for Azure - mostly smaller deployments.
In this repo, we're going to cover some simple Terraform deployments of fairly common Azure infrastructure and application services.
This repo contains code for relatively experienced Azure admins. The purpose of this project is to provide a template for setting up a scalable and manageable infrastructure on Azure using Terraform.

# Prerequisites 
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Terraform (v0.12+)
Azure CLI
Git
Additionally, you need an Azure account. If you don't have one, you can create a free Azure account.

# Setup
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/azure-terraform-deployment.git
cd azure-terraform-deployment

2.Login to Azure:
az login

3.Set the desired subscription:
sh
az account set --subscription "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"

# Terraform Configuration
1.Initialize terraform
Run 'terraform init' command to initialize the terraform working directory.

2.Configure backend:
Modify backend.tf to configure the remote backend for storing the Terraform state. Example configuration:

terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name   = "terraform-backend-rg"
    storage_account_name  = "terraformbackend"
    container_name        = "tfstate"
    key                   = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

3.Create a terraform.tfvars file:
Create a terraform.tfvars file to define the variables required by your Terraform configuration. Example:
resource_group_name = "myResourceGroup"
location            = "East US"
vm_size             = "Standard_DS1_v2"

# Deploying the Infrastructure
1. Plan the deployment
Generate and review an execution plan to verify what actions Terraform will perform:
terraform plan

2. Apply the deployment:
Apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration:
terraform apply

3. Destroying the Infrastructure
To destroy the infrastructure managed by Terraform, run: terraform destroy

Type yes when prompted to confirm the destruction.
